# BLOOBLOOM

https://rococo-faun-67cde2.netlify.app/

This is a test task which is done using Vue.js The code is written for the purpose of performing a test task.
I want to note that in the project I tried to perform some tasks in different ways and some code may not be the code for a commercial project. My task was to show the different functionality of this framework and different approaches to the tasks.Also I used additional libraries to bring this application to a commercial project.
